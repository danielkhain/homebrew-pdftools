# PDF Tools
Command line PDF manipulation tool

### Tools
This tool offers five functions: merge, remove, swap, insert, and reorder. The merge tool combines two PDF files and saves the output. The remove tool removes pages or page ranges from a PDF. The swap tool can swap two pages in a single PDF. The insert tool puts pages or a page range from a source PDF into any location in a destination PDF. The reorder tool reorders the pages in a PDF and saves it as a different PDF.
